# Echoes of Analog
*March 10, 2026*

Digital is discrete. 0 or 1. Black or White. But the world is a continuous spectrum.

## Re-visiting Optical Computing
I recently dusted off some research papers from the 80s on optical computing. The idea of using light instead of electricity for computation is not new, but it is experiencing a renaissance.

Why? **Speed and Energy.**

Light moves at... well, the speed of light. And it generates almost no heat compared to resistance-based electronics.

### The Noir Experiment
I built a small hybrid setup. A digital camera feed processed by an analog optical layer before hitting the digital sensor.

The result? 
*Instantaneous edge detection.*  
*Zero latency.*  
*Infinite resolution.*

## Bridging the Gap
We are trapped in a digital binary simulation. But the future might be analog. The next revolution in AI hardware won't be a faster GPU. It will be a prism.
